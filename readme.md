#PPA Major Coursework
####Nathan, Sophia, Arthur, Kelvin

This README file is placed in the root project folder and is intended to be a guide to understanding and (nicely) making commits to the repo.

####Note

The project folder may contain a different assortment of files than Eclipse's defaults, since I (Nathan) am using NetBeans. If this causes compatibility issues for whatever reason, let me know!

Another thing to know is that 'nfelix' is me. NetBeans seems to have used the name of my Mac's home folder.

###DO:
* Commit meaningful changes (and only those)
* Be concise. Commit comments should be "Added/changed/remove [insert change] to [insert reason]". Shouldn't need more than that.
* Be careful when commit conflicts arise to ensure no one's work is lost.
* Smoke weed and chill.

###DON'T:
* Neglect to properly indent your code
* Commit changes as trivial as adding a whitespace to fix formatting
* Drag .project into the 'Staged Changes' section of Eclipse. I have no idea why, but it will destroy your local copy of the entire thing.

The list will get longer as we carry on. This file is for anyone to edit. Just open it with a text editor.
