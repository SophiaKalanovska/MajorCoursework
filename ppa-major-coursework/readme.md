#PPA Major Coursework
####Nathan, Sophia, Arthur, Kelvin

This README file is placed in the root project folder and is intended to be a guide to understanding and (nicely) making commits to the repo.

###Submission Update (31/03/2017)


To run, compile project and run main in pad.Main

All of our panels should be interlinked at this stage and accessible via the navigation buttons at the bottom of the frame. If it appears to 'freeze' after attempting to grab data for a selected date range, or when scrolling to another panel, that is because the component being loaded takes _ages_, so please give it time! (Not just Ripley, but panels that incorporate some sort of Canvas or drawing operations.)

####Note

<strike>The project folder may contain a different assortment of files than Eclipse's defaults, since I (Nathan) am using NetBeans. If this causes compatibility issues for whatever reason, let me know!</strike>

<strike>Another thing to know is that 'nfelix' is me. NetBeans seems to have used the name of my Mac's home folder.</strike>

This hasn't been an issue with the new repo since we're all on Eclipse now.

###DO:
* Commit meaningful changes (and only those)
* Be concise. Commit comments should be "Added/changed/remove [insert change] to [insert reason]". Shouldn't need more than that.
* Be careful when commit conflicts arise to ensure no one's work is lost.

###DON'T:
* Neglect to properly indent your code
* Commit changes as trivial as adding a whitespace to fix formatting
* <strike>Drag .project into the 'Staged Changes' section of Eclipse. I have no idea why, but it will destroy your local copy of the entire thing.</strike>Not an issue anymore

The list will get longer as we carry on. This file is for anyone to edit. Just open it with a text editor.
